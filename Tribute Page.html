<h2>About Her</h2>
<p> <face='Times New Roman'>Kalpana Chawla (17 March 1962 – 1 February 2003) was an Indian-born American astronaut and aerospace engineer who was the first woman of Indian origin to fly to space. She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator aboard STS-87. Chawla's second flight was in 2003 on STS-107, the final flight of Columbia. She was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster when the spacecraft disintegrated during its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere on 1 February 2003<br>Kalpana Chawla’s life and career is marked by her dedication to space exploration and her pioneering role as an astronaut. Here’s a more detailed look at her life:<br></font>

<ul>
<li><b>Early Life and Education:</b><br>
Birth: Kalpana Chawla was born on March 17, 1962, in Karnal, Haryana, India. Her name means "imagination" in Hindi.<br>
Education in India: From a young age, Kalpana was fascinated by planes and flying. After schooling in Karnal, she pursued a Bachelor of Engineering in Aeronautical Engineering from the Punjab Engineering College in Chandigarh in 1982.<br></li>
  
<li><b>Move to the United States:</b><br>
Master's Degree: After completing her undergraduate studies, she moved to the U.S. to pursue a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington, which she completed in 1984.<br>
Doctorate: She went on to earn a PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder in 1988.<br></li>

<li><b>Career and NASA:</b><br>
NASA Career Beginnings: After completing her education, Kalpana started working at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California, where she worked on simulations of airflow around aircraft. Her research focused on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) related to aircraft performance.<br></li>
  
<li><b>Becoming an Astronaut:</b>In 1994, Chawla was selected for NASA’s astronaut training program. She made her first spaceflight in 1997 aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-87). She became the first woman of Indian origin to go into space, spending over 15 days in space during the mission. She conducted important experiments related to fluid dynamics, atmospheric conditions, and combustion.<br></li>

<li><b>STS-107 and Tragic Death:</b><br>
Columbia's Last Mission (STS-107): Kalpana’s second space mission was aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003. This was a dedicated research mission with experiments involving microgravity, physical sciences, biology, and earth and space sciences. During this mission, Chawla was the primary operator of the shuttle’s robotic arm and was responsible for many of the key experiments onboard.<br></li>
  
<li><b>Columbia Disaster:</b>On February 1, 2003, during the re-entry phase of Columbia’s return to Earth, the shuttle disintegrated in the atmosphere due to damage to its thermal protection system caused by foam insulation breaking off during launch. All seven crew members, including Kalpana, were tragically killed.<br></li>

<li><b>Legacy and Impact:</b><br>
Inspiration to Millions: Kalpana Chawla's life and career have become a source of inspiration, particularly for young women aspiring to join STEM fields. She broke barriers in a male-dominated field and paved the way for future generations.<br></li>
  
<li><b>Honors and Memorials:</b> Posthumously, Chawla has been honored in many ways. Several streets, universities, and institutions across India and the U.S. have been named after her. The Indian government announced a scholarship program in her name, and a satellite named Kalpana-1 was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in her honor. Various awards and events have been established in her memory.<br></li>
  
<li><b>Awards:</b> Kalpana was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, NASA Space Flight Medal, and NASA Distinguished Service Medal.<br></li>
<li><b>Personal Life:</b><br>
 Kalpana Chawla married Jean-Pierre Harrison, a flight instructor and aviation author, in 1983. Her passion for flying and exploration was not just professional; she was a certified pilot and loved flying small aircraft during her free time.<br></li>
</ul>
Kalpana Chawla remains a symbol of courage, resilience, and ambition, proving that with determination, one can achieve greatness even in the face of significant challenges. Her life continues to inspire space enthusiasts and aspiring astronauts globally.<br></p></div>
